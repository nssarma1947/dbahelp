BACKUP:

		A backup is a copy of data. 
		This copy can include important parts of the database, such as the control file and datafiles. 
		A backup is a safeguard against unexpected data loss and application errors. 
		If you lose the original data, then you can reconstruct it by using a backup.


Backups are divided into physical backups and logical backups. 

physical backups:
				Physical backups, which are the primary concern in a backup and recovery strategy, are copies of 
				physical database files. 
			
				We can make physical backups with either the Recovery Manager (RMAN) utility or operating system utilities. 

logical backups: 
				Logical backup contain logical data (for example, tables and stored procedures) extracted with an Oracle utility 
				and stored in a binary file. 
				
				We can use logical backups to supplement physical backups.
				
There are two ways to perform Oracle backup and recovery: Recovery Manager and user-managed backup and recovery.

Recovery Manager (RMAN):
					RMAN is an Oracle utility that can back up, restore, and recover database files. 
					
					It is a feature of the Oracle database server and does not require separate installation.
					
					We can also use operating system commands for backups and SQL*Plus for recovery. 
					
					This method, also called user-managed backup and recovery, is fully supported by Oracle, 
					although use of RMAN is highly recommended because it is more robust and greatly simplifies administration.

					Whether we use RMAN or user-managed methods, 
					
					We can supplement our physical backups with logical backups of schema objects made using the Export utility.

					The utility writes data from an Oracle database to binary operating system files. 
					
					We can later use Import to restore this data into a database.

How to create RMAN catalog:

To create an RMAN catalog, first need to create a user with the correct privileges. 
Connect to a new or existing database where the catalog will reside. 
We will then create a user and grant the user the RECOVERY_CATALOG_OWNER role. 
Starting with Oracle 12.1.0.2 the recovery catalog database must use Enterprise Edition. 
Our recovery catalog database needs to be the same version or higher than the database we are creating the catalog for.

		extend USERS tablespace datafile to 1024M;

		SQL>create user rman identified by rman default tablespace USERS  quota unlimited on USERS;
		SQL>grant create session to rman;
		SQL>grant recovery_catalog_owner to rman;
		
at os prompt type rman and click on enter

RMAN> connect catalog rman/rman
RMAN> create catalog;

Once the catalog has been created you can now register the database.

RMAN>connect target /
RMAN>connect catalog rman/rman
RMAN>register database;


How to view the current rman configuration?

$rman target /
RMAN> connect catalog rman/rman
RMAN> show all;

How to take backup using rman?

We will use channels and put the command in a run block as below.

run {
allocate channel ch1 device type disk;
allocate channel ch2 device type disk;
backup database format '/u01/app/backup/orcl_%U.bkp' plus archivelog format '/u01/app/backup/orcle_arc_%U.bkp' tag 'ForBackup';
release channel ch1;
release channel ch2;
}

How to run backup in background in linux?

We need to use nohup command.


first create a file as below.

vi rman_orcl_backup.cmd
run {
allocate channel ch1 device type disk;
backup database format '/u01/app/backup/orcl_%U.bkp' plus archivelog format '/u01/app/backup/orcle_arc_%U.bkp' tag 'ForBackup';
release channel ch1;
}

command to run in nohup is below:

nohup rman target / msglog=/u01/app/backup/rman_orcl_bkp.log cmdfile=/u01/app/backup/rman_orcl_backup.cmd &
