1) Find Tablespace & Associated Data Files:
		Query V$TABLESPACE or DBA_TABLESPACES to find tablespaces details inside a database
		SQL> select name from v$tablespace;
		SQL> select tablespace_name from dba_tablespaces;

2) To find datafiles associated with tablespace:
		SQL> select tablespace_name, file_name, bytes/1024/1024 from dba_data_files where tablespace_name='&tablespace_name';

3) To find temp files associated with a temp tablespace
		SQL> select file_name, bytes/1024/1024from dba_temp_files;
		
4) Find Tablespace Utilization:

			set line 120
select	a.TABLESPACE_NAME,
	a.BYTES/1024/1024/1024 GB_Allot,
	b.BYTES/1024/1024/1024 GB_free,
	b.largest,
	round(((a.BYTES-b.BYTES)/a.BYTES)*100,2) percent_used,
	round(100-round(((a.BYTES-b.BYTES)/a.BYTES)*100,2),2) percent_Free
from
	(
		select 	TABLESPACE_NAME,
			sum(BYTES) BYTES
		from 	dba_data_files
		group 	by TABLESPACE_NAME
	)
	a,
	(
		select 	TABLESPACE_NAME,
			sum(BYTES) BYTES ,
			max(BYTES) largest
		from 	dba_free_space
		group 	by TABLESPACE_NAME
	)
	b
where 	a.TABLESPACE_NAME (+) = b.TABLESPACE_NAME and a.tablespace_name not in(
select tablespace_name from dba_tablespaces where status ='READ ONLY')  order by ((a.BYTES-b.BYTES)/a.BYTES) desc;
			
5) How to Create a new Tablespace:
			To create new tablespace inside database
			SQL> Create tablespace test_tbs datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/test_tbs_01.dbf' size 50m;
						Where test_tbs is the name of new tablespace
						/u01/app/oracle/oradata/test_tbs_01.dbf is the location of the datafile 
						50m is the size of the datafile	

6) How to Add Space to Tablespace: There are three ways to add space to a tablespace:

Method 1: Resize existing datafile
Method 2: Add new datafile
Method 3: Autoextend on 

Method 1: 
			Before adding space, you must check OS level space. 
			Never proceed without checking it
			Use below command to resize a datafile
				SQL> Alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/test_tbs_01.dbf' resize 100m;

Method 2:			
			Before adding space, you must check OS level space. 
			Never proceed without checking it
			Use below command to add new datafile to tablespace
				SQL> Alter tablespace test_tbs add datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/test_tbs_02.dbf' size 50m;
				
Method 3:  
			Use below command to put the datafile in auto extend mode.
			SQL> Alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/test_tbs_02.dbf' auto extend on;
			
7) How to put tablespace in read write mode:
			Use below command to put the tablespace in read only mode. 
			SQL> alter tablespace test_tbs read write;

8) How to put tablespace in offline mode:
			Use below command to put the tablespace in read only mode. 
			SQL> alter tablespace test_tbs offline;
			
9) How to put tablespace back in online mode:
			Use below command to put the tablespace in read only mode. 
			SQL> alter tablespace test_tbs online;
			

10) How to put individual datafile in offline mode:
			Use below command to put the tablespace in read only mode. 
			SQL>alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/test_tbs_02.dbf' offline;
			
11) How to put individual datafile back in online mode:
			Use below command to put the tablespace in read only mode. 
			SQL>alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/test_tbs_02.dbf' online;	

				Note: You canâ€™t take individual datafiles offline it the database is running in NOARCHIVELOG mode.  
					  If the datafile has become corrupt or missing when the database is running in NOARCHIVELOG mode 
					  then you can only drop it by giving the following command
					  SQL>alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/test_tbs_02.dbf' offline for drop;			

12) How to rename a tablespace:
			Use below command to rename tablespace. 
			SQL> alter tablespace test_tbs rename to test_tbs_1;

13) How to Drop Tablespace:

					SQL> drop tablespace test_tbs_1;
						This will drop the tablespace only if it is empty. 
						If it is not empty and if you want to drop it anyhow then add the following keyword

					SQL>drop tablespace test_tbs_1 including contents;
						This will drop the tablespace even if it is not empty. 
						But the datafiles will not be deleted you have to use operating system command to delete the files.
						
						But If  you include datafiles keyword then, the associated datafiles will also be deleted from the disk.
					SQL>drop tablespace test_tbs_1 including contents and datafiles;
					

14) Tablespace Coalesce:
			Tablespace Coalesce combines all contiguous free extents into larger contiguous extents inside all datafiles
			It takes any free extents that are right next to some other free extent and make one bigger free extent
			SMON will perform this coalescing in the background but if you need it to happen right now, coalesce will do it
					SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE users COALESCE;
